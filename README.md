This task demonstrates how to perform data summarization using SQL **aggregate functions** such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX` and the `GROUP BY` clause. The queries are based on the e-commerce database created in Task 1 and populated in Task 2, while building on the selection logic practiced in Task 3.
